"""
handlers/start.py

Handles /start. Unlike before, this no longer registers the user
silently using only their Telegram info — it now asks for their
NAME and PHONE NUMBER first, since that's how the platform
identifies real people (per your decision: name + phone, no KYC/age
checks for now).

Flow:
  1. /start -> if already registered, just show the menu
  2. If new -> ask for full name
  3. Ask for phone number
  4. Register via the backend API, then show the menu

"""
matchmaking_service.py

This file handles finding an opponent. When a player picks a stake
(e.g. 50 ETB) and presses Play, we need to find another player who
picked the SAME stake and is also waiting.

We use Redis for this, not the main database. Why? Because matching
players needs to be FAST and happen in real-time, and Redis is built
exactly for this kind of temporary "who's waiting right now" data.
The database (Postgres) is for permanent records; Redis is for
short-lived, fast-changing state.

How it works, step by step:
1. Player A picks 50 ETB -> we check: is anyone else already
   waiting at 50 ETB?
2. If yes -> pair them immediately, remove both from the queue,
   lock both stakes, create the match.
3. If no -> add Player A to the "waiting at 50 ETB" queue, and they
   wait for someone else to come along.

We use Redis's atomic operations so that if two players press Play
at the exact same millisecond, they still can't both "match with
themselves" or get double-matched.
